# pokemonBrawl
The pokemon are meeting tonight to find out the best brawler composition.

Help them by choosing two teams of 6 pokemon and find out who is the last one standing!

# How to play
- Pick a team of 6 pokemon
- Pick another team of 6 pokemon or let the AI decide
- Watch them fight and see who is the last pokemon standing

# Why did you do this?
I was just wandering the internet coding community and I found motivation in [July's Codepen challenge](https://codepen.io/challenges/2019/july/3).

Down at the bottom where resources are recommended, they mentioned [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

So after brainstorming for a week I started coding some kind of little card videogame using this API and just plain vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.

After three weeks and moving out in between, I released the first version of the videogame on July 18th.

It featured:
- How to play instructions
- Two team player selection
- Random AI and _pretty_ smart AI
- Shuffling decks
- Turning cards
- Combat animations
- Winner SVG and 🎉 animation

# Ash
So if you come here wondering how Ash thinks before picking the right pokemons to beat you, here is what is happening on his mind

He asigns a value to each remaining pokemon considering its stats, that is Attack, Defense, HP, Speed and types. Then he orders all the pokemons based on that value, and picks the strongest 6.

In order to crush you, he focuses on finding the pokemons with the right types. He calculates the _average_ type multiplier of every pokemon left against the pokemons on your team. This average is added to the previous calculation.

That is why if you have a FIRE type team, Ash is smart enough to pick mainly water pokemons

# Brawling algorithm
First the speed is considered to find the pokemon that will deal dmg first.

The a multiplier is calculated based on the attacker and defender types.

Finally, it is basically just 

```Javascript
defender.hp = defender.hp - ((attacker.attack - defender.defense) * multiplier)
```

But when both pokemons are tied, they are given a high chance to at least deal a little damage and finish their opponent

```Javascript 
if (attacker.attack - defender.defense <= -40) {
    // [0,1]
    dmg = Math.round(Math.random())
} else if (attacker.attack - defender.defense <= 0) {
    // [1,multiplier]
    dmg = Math.round(Math.random() * multiplier) + 1
} else if (attacker.attack - defender.defense <= 3) {
    // [1,multiplier * 3]
    dmg = Math.round(Math.random() * 3 * multiplier) + 1
} else {
    // basic case
    dmg = Math.round((attacker.attack - defender.defense) * multiplier)
}
defender.hp = Math.round((defender.hp - dmg))
```

# Techy stuff
- Pokemon landing image in base64
- PokeApi data downloaded, formatted and pasted right away in JS
- Pokemon sprites and type images are downloaded in runtime
- Website made just of HTML, JS and CSS
- Custom SVG made in Sketch for the winner animation
- Just using 3 external resources: PokéApi, GoogleFonts and GoogleAnalytics

In case you want to simulate a brawl, just paste this on the DevTools

```Javascript
    (function simulate() {
        document.querySelector('#step0-button').click();
        document.querySelector('#step1 [data-id="1"]').click();
        document.querySelector('#step1 [data-id="2"]').click();
        document.querySelector('#step1 [data-id="3"]').click();
        document.querySelector('#step1 [data-id="4"]').click();
        document.querySelector('#step1 [data-id="5"]').click();
        document.querySelector('#step1 [data-id="6"]').click();
        document.querySelector('#step1-button').click();
        document.querySelector('#step2 [data-id="7"]').click();
        document.querySelector('#step2 [data-id="8"]').click();
        document.querySelector('#step2 [data-id="9"]').click();
        document.querySelector('#step2 [data-id="10"]').click();
        document.querySelector('#step2 [data-id="11"]').click();
        document.querySelector('#step2 [data-id="12"]').click();
        document.querySelector('#step2-button').click();
    })();
```

In case you want to get the pokemons ordered by its _Ash value_, just call this function with any array of pokemons. For instance

```Javascript
    orderPokemonsByExpectedValue(pokemons)
```
